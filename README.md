## Getting started
First of all, [![create a new repository][B1]][!1] from this template, \
Name it accordingly and place where it best fits for your team.

### Development environment
Make sure you have `Git` installed:
```bash
$ git --version
git version 2.25.1
```

Thus, clone the recent-created repository locally,
and you'll be ready to start developing your project.

### Repo publication
After all, you should make this project your own. \
Write a good README to present it to the world. \
And also ensure to tailor the project license to your needs,
as well as assign a suitable maintenance status.
